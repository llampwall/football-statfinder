Title: <short, specific>

Preamble: Task scope is intentionally narrow. 
- Use the SURGICAL PATCH PROTOCOL in /context/CODEX_RULES.md. 
- If you cannot finish within the limits, STOP and propose how to split it.

Goal: <one thing only>

Touched files (expected):
- web/week_view.js  (add X)
- web/week_view.html (tiny markup hook)
Do-Not-Touch: everything else.

Acceptance (must remain true):
- Existing pages render unchanged except for <X>.
- All console PASS/FAIL diagnostics remain.
- No schema changes.

Please return:
1) Files to change / Risk assessment / Acceptance checks validated
2) Diffs only (```diff)
